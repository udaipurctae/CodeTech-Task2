Overview of the Projects:

Project 2: Data Processing
Real world data is often clumsy, unorganised and unprocessed. It becomes important to clean this data before applying AI and ML algorithms as without the data being thoroughly pre processed these algorithms don't produce the desired output.
Hence processes like outlier removal, one hot encoding, data type transformations, etc are carried out in this task.
